    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I received the B.Sc. degree in electronics information science and technology from Xidian University, Xiâ€™an, China, in 2010, and the M.Eng. degree in microwave engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, the University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia, in 2012 and 2017, respectively. 

    I am currently a senior lecturer with the School of EECS, the University of Queensland. My current research interests include electromagnetic medical imaging (microwave and MRI), biomedical signal processing, deep learning in microwave medical imaging, and microwave circuit design for millimetre wave antenna array systems. 

    I received the IEEE R.W. P. King Award for the best paper published in the IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation in 2015. I also received several best paper prizes at International conferences, such as the Best Paper Prize at the International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (ISAP).

    I was awarded two Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Project Grants in 2023 and 2024. 

    I was awarded the Advanced Queensland Fellowship in 2021.</p>
